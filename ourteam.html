                developer many moons ago. Let me put it this way, I started off learning HTML4 and we'll leave it as that.  Unfortunately, I had to leave that dream behind almost as soon as I started it.  When we moved up to WA I got a job and have been sitting at the same desk for 13 years. Fortunately, I heard about Code
                Fellows and the rest is history. </div>

                this year. I am currently working as Carpenter for a small home remodeling company.</div>

                learning experiences for me. Being able to utilize others thoughts and ideas was very uplifting. Instead
                of getting stuck we were able to work strongly together to figure out a killer outcome to present you
